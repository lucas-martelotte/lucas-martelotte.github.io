description:
  Many people can deduce, if they think for a little while, a basis and the algebra structure for the $n$-th cyclotomic field, when n is a prime number. The situation becomes a little harder when $n$ is composite. In this post I want to give a proper treatment of this case and also implement it on Python.

Last week I did a little Haskell show-off for two friends.
